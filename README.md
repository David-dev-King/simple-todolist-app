# simple-todolist-app
## A learning project with HTML CSS and JS
This project was untracked for the entirety of it's lifetime and there's some spaghetti code, however, it taught me some good coding practices and I also got myself familiar with CRUD operations and localstorage.
In the future, I will make sure to start all projects with version control in mind.
Thanks for checking this out!!!
Depending on when you are reading this, the project might still be hosted using cloudfront: [Todo-list / Task Manager app](https://d3jzigfckzrcqj.cloudfront.net/)
