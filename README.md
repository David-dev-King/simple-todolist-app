# Simple To-Do List App 📝

A learning project built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 📚 About the Project

This project was untracked for most of its development, and admittedly, there’s some spaghetti code here and there. That said, it taught me valuable lessons about:

- Clean coding practices
- CRUD operations
- Working with `localStorage`
- The importance of using version control from the beginning

In future projects, I’ll make sure to initialize Git and use GitHub from day one.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Depending on when you’re reading this, the app might still be hosted via **AWS CloudFront**:
